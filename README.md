# FragGabiScraper

This work-in-progress project extracts content of questions from the Frag Gabi section on maedchen.de - whatever you might need that for.

An example is shown in main.py.

Disclaimer: The scraping of said website might not be legal, please keep that in mind when considering using this! I just made this for educational purposes. 
Also don't flood the server with requests, wait some seconds between each query.
